Here are two ways to go about finding a good topic:

Think about what sectors or angles you're really interested in, then find data sets relating to those sectors.
Review several data sets, and find one that seems interesting enough to explore.
Whichever approach you take, you can start your search at these sites:

Data.gov - A directory of government data downloads
/r/datasets - A subreddit that has hundreds of interesting data sets
Awesome datasets - A list of data sets hosted on GitHub
rs.io - A great blog post with hundreds of interesting data sets
In real-world data science, you may not find an ideal data set. You might have to aggregate disparate data sources instead, or do a good amount of data cleaning.
